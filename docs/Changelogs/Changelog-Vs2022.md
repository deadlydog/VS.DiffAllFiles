# Visual Studio 2022 Extension Changelog

## v1.0.0 - Oct 27, 2021

Initial release of VS 2022 version of extension. Note that this extension is currently limited to TFS only. It can no longer be used for Git Changes, as the new Visual Studio Git experience (introduced in VS2019 16.6) has no currently documented extensibility points.
